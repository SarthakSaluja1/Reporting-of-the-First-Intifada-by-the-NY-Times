Arab diplomats in Baghdad said the United States had asked King Hassan of Morocco and President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt to press Colonel Qaddafi to eject the group. Pressure to remove Mr. Abbas increased after his group raided an Israeli beach in May, an action that led to a break in contacts between the United States and the Palestine Liberation Organization, with which Mr. Abbas's group is affiliated.

Members of the crowd, estimated as high as 500,000 by the political opposition parties that organized the march, held aloft copies of the Koran, Islam's holy book, portraits of the Iraqi President, Saddam Hussein, and the Palestine Liberation Organization chairman, Yasir Arafat, and pictures of Scud missiles.   Demonstrators burned American, British, French and Israeli flags and demanded that allied troops, including Moroccan soldiers, withdraw from the gulf.

The demonstration was the first permitted by the Moroccan authorities since war broke out on Jan. 17. Security forces stood by but did not intervene.   The protesters, who included some 10,000 Islamic fundamentalists, chanted slogans rebuking President Bush, King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, and President Francois Mitterrand of France.

By Peter Hernon. (Birch Lane/Carol Publishing, $18.95.) In 1947, the British were pulling out of Palestine, leaving the region's Jews, in their struggle to create an independent state of Israel, to fight the Arabs. At the same time, a startling discovery of a group of ancient scrolls was made by a band of Bedouin tribesmen in a cave located in Trans-Jordan, little more than a stone's throw from the Dead Sea. This much is fact, and it is from here that the journalist Peter Hernon has let his imagination take over - the result of which is a fascinating ''what if?'' novel. What if other scrolls were also found, also written by the Essenes, ''an obscure Jewish sect that was thought to have first existed in Palestine some two hundred years before Christ''? And what if, along with these scrolls, two other discoveries were made: the skeleton of a headless man, suspected to be John the Baptist, and the mummified corpse of a crucified man who might be Jesus Christ? Paul Davoren, a journalist assigned to cover the war, finds himself sucked into a thrilling theological treasure hunt and detective story, the ramifications of which could shake the foundations of modern Christianity. The risks in a novel like this are many. Fortunately, Mr. Hernon is not just a skillful storyteller; his eye for detail and the clever way he entwines fact and fiction do not allow the reader to doubt his premise. Mr. Hernon only falters infrequently, with love scenes between Davoren and a beautiful young scholar that fall rather flat - and at the end, when his tale turns into a more conventional thriller. Otherwise, ''Earthly Remains'' is a well-written, exciting and thought-provoking novel.",7,30,The New York Times,,,1989-11-26T05:00:00+0000,article,Book Review Desk,Books,Review,nyt://article/7b962cfd-7a54-54ab-af8b-6661b0e95167,361,nyt://article/7b962cfd-7a54-54ab-af8b-6661b0e95167,FICTION,IN SHORT,NA,IN SHORT; FICTION,NA,NA,NA,By Charles Salzberg,,NA,3371,380,37,NA

OK,Copyright (c) 2022 The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved.,"  The United Nations Security Council postponed a vote on a Middle East resolution again today, at the request of the Soviet Union.   The Soviets asked for the postponement to give Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze time to discuss the problem with the Palestine Liberation Organization chairman, Yasir Arafat, at a meeting planned for Friday in Turkey.   Exactly what Mr. Shevardnadze will propose to Mr. Arafat remains unclear. But most Security Council members want to change the draft resolution to avoid an American veto, which would embarrass Washington's Arab allies in the gulf crisis by giving President Saddam Hussein of Iraq more ammunition in his campaign to portray them as the friends of Israel's protector.    The postponement until Monday is the third the Council has agreed to in the last week, as the United States struggles to modify the draft resolution to avoid vetoing it.   A majority of Council members appear ready to vote for the draft, which extends more United Nations protection to Palestinians in the occupied territories, defined as including Jerusalem, as well as endorsing the idea of an international peace conference to resolve the Arab-Israeli dispute.   Supporters of the resolution argue that the Security Council cannot credibly punish Iraq for annexing Kuwait while ignoring Israel's continued occupation of Arab lands.",https://www.nytimes.com/1990/12/13/world/standoff-in-the-gulf-un-postpones-vote-on-resolution-on-israel.html,,"The United Nations Security Council postponed a vote on a Middle East resolution again today, at the request of the Soviet Union.",A,20,The New York Times,,,1990-12-13T05:00:00+0000,article,Foreign Desk,World,News,nyt://article/5a4f38a7-5037-509a-85b5-dc4e68c9a025,224,nyt://article/5a4f38a7-5037-509a-85b5-dc4e68c9a025,U.N.

OK,Copyright (c) 2022 The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved.,"  Ronald Sanders, a writer who specialized in Jewish history and the immigrant experience in New York and elsewhere, died yesterday at his home in Manhattan. He was 58 years old.    He died of bone and liver cancer, his family said.   Mr. Sanders, a former editor of Midstream, the Zionist monthly journal, wrote extensively on Jews in Palestine and in the communities around the world to which they dispersed. He also dealt with the development of racism in America, which he traced to Columbian times.   His most popular book, ""The Downtown Jews: Portrait of an Immigrant Generation,"" published by Harper & Row in 1970, detailed life on the Lower East Side beginning with the first wave of Russian Jewish arrivals in the 1880's. He paid particular attention to the cultural and ideological ferment that gave birth to a radical movement that fostered the formation of the International Ladies Garment Workers and other trade unions. A Demographic Contrast    In his most recent book, ""Shores of Refuge: A Hundred Years of Jewish Emigration"" (Henry Holt, 1988), Mr. Sanders provides an account of the population movement that has resulted in the fact that half the world's Jewish population lives in the Western Hemisphere, a stark contrast with the third quarter of the 19th century, when four of five Jews lived in Eastern and Central Europe.   In ""Israel: The View From Masada,"" published in 1966, he offered an analysis of the cross-currents in that country's Jewish personality, notably the conflicts between Israelis with roots in central Europe and other Jews.    Mr. Sanders himself was half Jewish. He was born in Union City, N.J., to a Jewish mother and a gentile father, both immigrants from England, and grew up in Brooklyn. ""Reflections on a Teapot,"" published in 1972, was a memoir inspired by a tune written by his father, George, a songwriter and arranger.   Mr. Sanders was a graduate of Kenyon College and held a master's degree in history from Columbia. He taught at Queens College in the late 1950's and early 1960's. In 1988 he was named to the B. G. Rudolph Chair in Jewish Studies at Syracuse University but was unable to accept it because of ill health.   His other books included ""The High Walls of Jerusalem,"" a study of the Balfour Declaration of 1917 that pledged British support for a Jewish homeland in Palestine, and ""The Days Grow Short,"" a biography of the composer Kurt Weill.     Before his final illness Mr. Sanders was working on a biography of the author Isaac Bashevis Singer, for which he had received a fellowship from the National Endowment for the Humanities.   He is survived by his wife, the former Beverly Gingold, and a sister, Marilyn O'Bradovich, of Manhattan.",https://www.nytimes.com/1991/01/12/obituaries/ronald-sanders-58-who-wrote-on-jewish-history-and-dispersal.html,,"Ronald Sanders, a writer who specialized in Jewish history and the immigrant experience in New York and elsewhere, died yesterday at his home in Manhattan.

OK,Copyright (c) 2022 The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved.,"  Following are excerpts from an interview with President Sadam Hussein of Iraq, recorded Saturday and broadcast today by the French television network Antenne 2 and Radio France Inter. Mr. Hussein's comment, made in Arabic, were translated by The Associated Press from the French transcript provided by Antenne 2.   Q. Do you accept the dialogue proposed to you by President Bush?   A. If President Bush wishes to establish a balanced dialogue, such a dialogue must not get under way on the basis of preconditions. . . . President Bush has proposed two meetings. . . . We have accepted.   Q. What gesture are you ready to make to convince the world of your good will as you begin this dialogue?   A. There is no proposition more important than a dialogue that reaches a solution to all the problems of the region, and at their head the Palestinian problem. . . . We have taken a series of initiatives  [ regarding the hostages ] , and we have even fixed a date, March 25, as the last date for all of them to go home if nothing happens to disturb the peace.   This is not a tactic to sow discord in the ranks of whomever, but it is one of the means which we think are capable of preventing war. Such a method has perhaps proven its effectiveness, because so far there has been no war. . . .   We will free them . . . as soon as we have President Bush's assurance that he will not attack the Iraqi people between now and March 25. If after March 25, he still has the devil in his head, we will count on God to face any eventuality.  Our Face Is Saved     Q. Now that President Bush has proposed dialogue, and you can save face to an extent, why not open up some possibility regarding Kuwait?   A. Our face is saved. We don't need Bush for that. Our face is saved because we are believers. . . . You know that Bush has not taken the same measures vis-a-vis the Israeli occupation of Palestine and doesn't even lift his little finger when he sees on the television screens women, children and old people being killed, humiliated and tortured in Palestine by the Israelis.   The problem is that President Bush and the other Western heads of state have two United Nations charters . . . a criteria based on evaluations of their own needs and interests and a criteria for the oppressed peoples of the third world, oppressed by the policies of the Western bloc and by the United States in particular.   Q. Is it necessary for a country like Iraq to provide itself with a nuclear capability? The Americans say this will happen in a year or two.   A. I speak of the present. If we had nuclear weapons, we wouldn't have any problem saying so. . . . But we don't possess a nuclear weapon. . . . Why doesn't the West protest and worry at the destructive capabilities of Israel?   Q. And this evening, are we closer to war or to peace?   A. Fifty-fifty. If this meeting is to be a true path to dialogue, then we are closer to peace. But if this meeting is to be nothing more than a formal exhibition for the American Congress, the American people and for international public opinion, simply to salve consciences and say, ""There, we've tried to talk to Iraq, without Iraq renouncing its position"" -- in that case, we are closer to war.",https://www.nytimes.com/1990/12/03/world/mideast-tensions-excerpts-from-the-interview-with-president-hussein.html,,"Following are excerpts from an interview with President Sadam Hussein of Iraq, recorded Saturday and broadcast today by the French television network Antenne 2 and Radio France Inter.

Mr. Hrawi's statement coincided with the entry by Lebanese troops into the village of Milikh at the edge of the security zone.    An estimated 3,000 Lebanese troops have spread out east and south of the port city of Sidon 25 miles south of here after Palestinian and Lebanese Muslim guerrillas evacuated.

They embraced tearfully tonight when word of the hostage's release came, then rushed to make preparations for leaving.

""I am positive now because of the United Nations announcement,"" said Mr. Turner's wife, Badr, 40 years old, who married him in 1986. Estelle Ronneburg, his 70-year-old mother, remained tense and subdued, hoping the good news was true.

The family planned to fly to Frankfurt, then head for a United States military hospital in Wiesbaden, Germany, where American hostages have generally been taken for medical tests after being freed in Lebanon.

Mrs. Ronneburg suffered severe disappointment when her son's photograph was released in April 1990 by his captors, the Islamic Holy War for the Liberation of Palestine, raising hopes that Mr. Turner would be freed. A few days later, the group instead freed Robert Polhill, who had been seized with Mr. Turner and Alann Steen in January 1987.

Mr. Turner's daughter, Joanna, who turned 4 years old in June, went to sleep tonight not knowing her father had been released.

She will be meeting him in Germany for the first time in her life: Joanna was born five months after he was abducted. She lived for nearly two years with her mother in Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates, before immigrating to America.",https://www.nytimes.com/1991/10/22/world/american-hostage-freed-in-lebanon-un-officials-say-a-family-waits.html,"Jesse Turner's wife and mother spent the day sitting with clasped hands on a living-room sofa awaiting news while surrounded by television cameras and reporters.

OK,Copyright (c) 2022 The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved.,"THE MAN WHO THOUGHT HE WAS MESSIAH.  By Curt Leviant. (Jewish Publication Society, $18.95.) Hasidism appears profoundly conservative to modern eyes, but it was once a vibrant, radical, even revolutionary, movement. Breaking from the Judaism of the period, which they regarded as elitist, the Hasidic teachers of the 18th century sought to bring the gift of transcendence to the common man; through singing, dancing and fervent prayer, Hasidim aspired to mystical communion with God. Among the greatest of the Hasidic teachers was Rabbi Nachman of Bratslav, famous for the wisdom of his storytelling. In his enchanting, magical third novel, Curt Leviant becomes a modern Nachman and summons up a world suffused with a tangible spirituality, a world where trees or dreams or numbers might speak prophecy, where God is ever immanent behind the thin veil of the printed word. Sensual and intriguing, ""The Man Who Thought He Was Messiah"" shows us Reb Nachman in 1800, his incredibly eventful final year. It begins with God's whisper, a hint of Messianic destiny: Nachman might bring salvation to the scattered nation of Israel. Despite the presumption of this notion, Nachman seeks to prove himself worthy, but fails: he falls in love with Lizabeta, a young peasant ""more beautiful than the alphabet."" In fitting punishment, Nachman loses his ability to read; to atone for their liaison, he must leave Bratslav. Thus he travels to Vienna and studies composition with a proud but likable Beethoven; returning home with his new language of music, he finds his literacy partly restored. Setting out again, this time for the Holy Land, Nachman stops in Constantinople and, in a storybook scenario, cures the sultan's daughter of a storybook ailment. In Palestine divine tests await, and Nachman must probe his deepest values. Exquisitely written, Mr. Leviant's engaging exploration of the spirit will seduce and delight readers of any faith -- or lack thereof.",https://www.nytimes.com/1990/12/16/books/in-short-fiction-rabbi-nachmans-mystery-tour.html,"THE MAN WHO THOUGHT HE WAS MESSIAH.

OK,Copyright (c) 2022 The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved.,"  As Iraqis danced in the streets of Baghdad in response to President Saddam Hussein's speech ordering a withdrawal from Kuwait, Palestinians and Jordanians, who had been his ardent supporters, seemed stunned, bewildered and enraged today.   Those turbulent emotions were quickly fused into a general anger transferred to the Americans seen as the architects of his, and their, humiliation.   ""You Americans, you are all liars,"" said a Jordanian officer who displayed increasing bewilderment, then hostility, as he listened to the speech with Western reporters at the Ruweishid border crossing into Iraq.   Many in Amman at first refused to believe the news, telephoning international news agencies to inquire whether it was not some kind of hoax. In their heart of hearts, many had known that the Iraqi leader could not prevail. What hurt was the speed of his collapse. Baghdad Radio's Message     When Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2, President Hussein quickly linked his action to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, insisting that a pullout be linked to an Israeli withdrawal from occupied Arab lands.   ""It looked like Gamal Abdel Nasser coming back,"" said Nabil Shaath, a senior adviser to Yasir Arafat, the leader of the Palestine Liberation Organization. ""It looked like a knight with shining armor, the hero fighting the Americans.""   For the six weeks of the war, a Western specialist said, Palestinians had chosen to believe the central message of the Baghdad radio's propaganda: allied airplanes might prowl the skies, but Iraq's ground forces, tested in the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war, had the skills to resist an allied offensive.   Then, two days after allied troops pressed forward into Kuwait, Iraq announced its withdrawal. 'Longer Fight' Expected     Reached by telephone in Cairo, Mr. Shaath said that eventually President Hussein's move ""will be seen as a very prudent move."" But, he acknowledged, ""people expected a longer fight.""",https://www.nytimes.com/1991/02/27/world/war-in-the-gulf-world-reaction-arabs-dominant-emotion-anger-at-the-us.html,,"As Iraqis danced in the streets of Baghdad in response to President Saddam Hussein's speech ordering a withdrawal from Kuwait, Palestinians and Jordanians, who had been his ardent supporters, seemed stunned, bewildered and enraged today.",A,22,The New York Times,,,1991-02-27T05:00:00+0000,article,Foreign Desk,World,News,nyt://article/011a07a9-c6c9-571a-9bc1-1988d0f43d40,326,nyt://article/011a07a9-c6c9-571a-9bc1-1988d0f43d40,Dominant Emotion: Anger at the U.S.,WAR IN THE GULF: WORLD REACTION - ARABS,NA,WAR IN THE GULF: WORLD REACTION - ARABS; Dominant Emotion: Anger at the U.S.,NA,NA,NA,"By Alan Cowell, Special To the New York Times",,NA,3371,1140,51,NA

Mr. Sharaa's remarks were translated from the Arabic by the conference's organizers and provided by The A.P.  YITZHAK SHAMIR     It is an honor to represent the people of Israel at this historic moment and a privilege to address this opening of peace talks between Israel and its Arab neighbors.    I would like to express our profound appreciation to our Spanish hosts for their hospitality, and for making this gathering for peace possible. In its 2,000 years of wandering, the Jewish people paused here for several hundred years until they were expelled 500 years ago. It was in Spain that the great Jewish poet and philosopher, Yehuda Halevi, expressed the yearning for Zion of all Jews, in the words, ""My heart is in the East, while I am in the uttermost West.""    I would also like to extend our appreciation to the co-sponsors of this conference -- to the U.S., which has maintained a strong friendship with Israel in an alliance that has overcome occasional differences. And to the Soviet Union, which saved the lives of many Jews during the Second World War and has now opened its gates to the repatriation of Jews to their ancient homeland.    The people of Israel look to this palace with great anticipation and expectation. We pray that this meeting will mark the beginning of a new chapter in the history of the Middle East, that it will signal the end of hostility, violence, terror and war. That it will bring dialogue, accommodation, coexistence and, above all, peace.    Ladies and Gentlemen.    To appreciate the meaning of peace for the people of Israel, one has to view today's Jewish sovereignty in the Land of Israel against the background of our history. Jews have been persecuted throughout the ages in almost every continent. Some countries barely tolerated us, others oppressed, tortured, slaughtered and exiled us. This century saw the Nazi regime set out to exterminate us. The Shoah, the Holocaust, the catastrophic genocide of unprecedented proportions which destroyed a third of our people, became possible because no one defended us. Being homeless, we were also defenseless.    But it was not the Holocaust which made the world community recognize our rightful claim to the Land of Israel. In fact, the rebirth of the state of Israel so soon after the Holocaust has made the world forget that our claim is immemorial. We are the only people who have lived in the Land of Israel without interruption for nearly 4,000 years. We are the only people, except for a short crusader kingdom, who have had an independent sovereignty in this land. We are the only people for whom Jerusalem has been a capital. We are the only people whose sacred places are only in the land of Israel.                    . . .         No nation has expressed its bond with its land with as much intensity and consistency as we have. For millennia our people repeated at every occasion the cry of the psalmist,: ""If I forget thee, Jerusalem, may my right hand lose its cunning!."" For millennia we have encouraged each other with the greeting, ""Nnext year in Jerusalem.!"" For millennia our prayers, literature and folklore have expressed powerful longing to return to our land. Only Eretz Israel, the Land of Israel, is our true homeland. Any other country, no matter how hospitable, is still a diaspora, a temporary station on the way home.   To others, it was not an attractive land. No one wanted it. Mark Twain described it only a hundred years ago as ""a desolate country, which sits in sackcloth and ashes, a silent mournful expanse, which not even imagination can grace with the pomp of life.""    The Zionist movement gave political expression to our claim to the Land of Israel. And in 1922 the League of Nations recognized the justice of this claim. It understood the compelling historic imperative of establishing a Jewish homeland in the Land of Israel. The United Nations Organization reaffirmed this recognition after the Second World War.    Regrettably the Arab leaders, whose friendship we wanted most, opposed a Jewish state in the region. With a few distinguished exceptions, they claimed that the Land of Israel is part of the Arab domain that stretches from the Atlantic to the Persian Gulf.   In defiance of international will and legality, the Arab regimes attempted to overrun and destroy the Jewish state even before it was born. The Arab spokesman at the U.N. declared that the establishment of a Jewish state would cause a bloodbath which would make the slaughters of Ghengis Khan pale into insignificance.    In its declaration of independence on May 15, 1948, Israel stretched out its hand in peace to its Arab neighbors, calling for an end to war and bloodshed. In response, seven Arab states invaded Israel. The U.N. resolution that partitioned the country was thus violated and effectively annulled.    The U.N. did not create Israel. The Jewish state came into being because the tiny Jewish community, in what was Mandatory Palestine, rebelled against foreign imperialist rule. We did not conquer a foreign land. We repulsed the Arab onslaught, prevented Israel's annihilation, declared its independence and established a viable state and government institutions within a very short time.  After their attack on Israel failed, the Arab regimes continued their fight against Israel with boycott, blockade, terrorism and outright war. Soon after the establishment of Israel, they turned against the Jewish communities in Arab countries. A wave of oppression, expropriation and expulsion caused a mass exodus of some 800,000 Jews from lands they had inhabited from before the rise of Islam. Distortion of History     Most of these Jewish refugees, stripped of their considerable possessions, came to Israel. They were welcomed by the Jewish state. They were given shelter and support, and they were integrated into Israeli society together with half a million survivors of the European Holocaust.    The Arab regimes' rejection of Israel's existence in the Middle East and the continuous war they have waged against it are part of history. There have been attempts to rewrite this history, which depict the Arabs as victims and Israel as the aggressor. Like attempts to deny the Holocaust, they will fail. With the demise of totalitarian regimes in most of the world, this perversion of history will disappear.    In their war against Israel's existence, the Arab governments took advantage of the cold war. They enlisted the military, economic and political support of the Communist world against Israel, and they turned a local, regional conflict into an international powder keg. This caused the Middle East to be flooded with arms, which fuelled wars and turned the area into a dangerous battleground and a testing arena for sophisticated weapons. At the U.N., the Arab states mustered the support of other Muslim countries and the Soviet bloc. Together they had an automatic majority for countless resolutions that perverted history, paraded fiction as fact and made a travesty of the U.N. and its charter.    Arab hostility to Israel has also brought tragic human suffering to the Arab people. Tens of thousands have been killed and wounded. Hundreds of thousands of Arabs who lived in Mandatory Palestine were encouraged by their own leaders to flee from their homes. Their suffering is a blot on humanity. No decent person, least of all a Jew of this era, can be oblivious to this suffering.    Several hundreds of thousands of Palestinian Arabs live in slums known as refugee camps in Gaza, Judea and Samaria. Attempts by Israel to rehabilitate and house them have been defeated by Arab objections. Nor has their fate been any better in Arab states. Unlike the Jewish refugees who came to Israel from Arab countries, most Arab refugees were neither welcomed nor integrated by their hosts. Only the kingdom of Jordan awarded them citizenship. Their plight has been used as a political weapon against Israel.    The Arabs who have chosen to remain in Israel -- Christian and Muslim -- have become full-fledged citizens enjoying equal rights and representation in the legislature, in the judiciary and in all walks of life.    We, who over the centuries were denied access to our holy places, respect the religion of all faiths in our country. Our law guarantees freedom of worship and protects the holy places of every religion. . . .    I stand before you today in yet another quest for peace, not only on behalf of the State of Israel, but in the name of the entire Jewish people, that has maintained an unbreakable bond with the Land of Israel for almost 4,000 years.                    . . .         We have always believed that only direct, bilateral talks can bring peace. We have agreed to precede such talks with this ceremonial conference, but we hope that Arab consent to direct, bilateral talks indicates an understanding that there is no other way to peace. In the Middle East, this has special meaning, because such talks imply mutual acceptance, and the root cause of the conflict is the Arab refusal to recognize the legitimacy of the State of Israel.    The multilateral talks that would accompany the bilateral negotiations are a vital component in the process. In these talks, the essential ingredients of coexistence and regional cooperation will be discussed. There cannot be genuine peace in our region unless these regional issues are addressed and resolved.    We believe the goal of the bilateral negotiations is to sign peace treaties between Israel and its neighbors, and to reach an agreement on interim self-government arrangements with the Palestinian Arabs.    But nothing can be achieved without good will. I appeal to the Arab leaders, those who are here and those who have not yet joined the process: Show us and the world that you accept Israel's existence. Demonstrate your readiness to accept Israel as a permanent entity in the region. Let the people in our region hear you speak in the language of reconciliation, coexistence and peace with Israel. Renouncing the Uprising     In Israel there is an almost total consensus for the need for peace. We only differ on the best ways to achieve it. In most Arab countries the opposite seems to be true: the only differences are over the ways to push Israel into a defenseless position and, ultimately, to destruction. We would like to see in your countries an end to poisonous preachings against Israel. We would like to see an indication of the kind of hunger for peace which characterizes Israeli society.    We appeal to you to renounce the Jihad against Israel. We appeal to you to denounce the P.L.O. covenant which calls for Israel's destruction. We appeal to you to condemn declarations that call for Israel's annihilation, like the one issued by the rejectionist conference in Teheran last week. We appeal to you to let Jews, who wish to leave your countries, go.    And we address a call to the Palestinian Arabs: renounce violence and terrorism, use the universities in the administered territories -- whose existence was made possible only by Israel -- for learning and development, not agitation and violence, stop exposing your children to danger by sending them to throw bombs and stones at soldiers and civilians.    Just two days ago, we were reminded that Palestinian terrorism is still rampant when a mother of seven children and a father of four were slaughtered in cold blood. We cannot remain indifferent and be expected to talk with people involved in such repulsive activities.    We appeal to you to shun dictators like Saddam Hussein who aim to destroy Israel, stop the brutal torture and murder of those who do not agree with you, allow us, and the world community, to build decent housing for the people who now live in refugee camps. Above all, we hope you finally realize that you could have been at this table long ago, soon after the Camp David accords were first concluded, had you chosen dialogue instead of violence, coexistence instead of terrorism.                    . . .         We know our partners to the negotiations will make territorial demands on Israel. But, as an examination of the conflict's long history makes clear, its nature is not territorial. It raged well before Israel acquired Judea, Samaria, Gaza and the Golan in a defensive war. There was no hint of recognition of Israel before the war in 1967, when the territories in question were not under Israeli control.    We are a nation of four million. The Arab nations from the Atlantic to the gulf number 170 million. We control only 28,000 square kilometers. The Arabs possess a land mass of 14 million square kilometers. The issue is not territory but our existence.    It will be regrettable if the talks focus primarily and exclusively on territory. It is the quickest way to an impasse. What we need, first and foremost, is the building of confidence, the removal of the danger of confrontation and the development of relations in as many spheres as possible.  Site of Talks     The issues are complex, and the negotiations will be lengthy and difficult. We submit that the best venue for the talks is in our region, in close proximity to the decision makers, not in a foreign land. We invite our partners to this process to come to Israel for the first round of talks. On our part, we are ready to go to Jordan, to Lebanon and to Syria for the same purpose. There is no better way to make peace than to talk in each other's home. . . .   For many hundreds of years, wars, deep antagonisms and terrible suffering cursed this continent on which we meet. The nations of Europe saw the rise of dictators and their defeat after lengthy and painful struggles. Now, they are together -- former bitter enemies -- in a united community. They are discussing the good of the community, cooperating in all matters, acting almost as one unit. I envy them. I would like to see such a community rise in the Middle East. And I believe that, despite all differences between us, we should be able, gradually, to build a united regional community.   Today it is a dream, but we have seen, in our own lifetime, some of the most fantastic dreams become reality. Today, the gulf separating the two sides is still too wide, the Arab hostility to Israel too deep, the lack of trust too immense, to permit a dramatic, quick solution. But, we must start on the long road to reconciliation with this first step in the peace process.  HAIDAR ABDEL-SHAFI     Once again, Christian, Muslim and Jew face the challenge of heralding a new era enshrined in global values of democracy, human rights, justice and security. From Madrid, we launch this quest for peace, a quest to place the sanctity of human life at the center of our world and to redirect our energies and resources from the pursuit of mutual destruction to the pursuit of long prosperity, progress and happiness.   We, the people of Palestine, stand before you in the fullness of our pain, our pride, and our anticipation for we have long harbored a yearning for peace and a dream of justice and freedom. For too long, the Palestinian people have gone unheeded, silenced and denied, our identity negated by political expediency, our rightful struggle against injustice maligned, and our present existence subsumed by the past tragedy of another people.   For the greater part of this century, we have been victimized by the myth of a land without the people and described with impunity as the invisible Palestinians. Before such willful blindness, we refused to disappear or to accept a distorted identity. Our intifada is a testimony to our perseverence and the resilience waged in a just struggle to regain our rights.   It is time for us to narrate our own story, to stand witness as advocates of a truth which has long lain buried in the consciousness and conscience of the world. We do not stand before you as supplicants, but, rather, as the torchbearers who knew that in our world of today ignorance can never be an excuse. We seek neither an admission of guilt after the fact nor vengeance for past inequities, but, rather, an act of will that would make a just peace a reality. . . .   The co-sponsors have invited us here today to present our case and to reach out to the others with whom we have had to face a mutually exclusive reality on the land of Palestine. But even in the invitation to this peace conference, our narrative was distorted and our truth only partially acknowledged.   Palestinian people are one fused by centuries of history in Palestine, bound together by a collective memory of shared sorrows and joys and sharing a unity of purpose and vision. Our songs and ballads, our . . . children's stories, the dialect of our joys, of our jokes, the image of our poems, . . . which colors even our happiest moments, are as important to us as the blood ties which link our families and clans.   Yet, an invitation to discuss peace, the peace we all desire and need, comes to only a portion of our people. It ignores our national, historical and organic unity. We come here wrenched from our sisters and brothers in anxiety to stand before you as the Palestinians under occupation, although we maintain that each of us represents the rights and interests of the whole.   We have been denied the right to publicly acknowledge our loyalty to our leadership and system of government, but allegiance and loyalty cannot be censored or severed.   Our acknowledged leadership is more than just the democratically chosen leadership of all the Palestinian people. It is the symbol of our national unity and identity, the guardian of our past, the protector of our present and the hope of our future. Brutality of Occupation     Our people have chosen to entrust it with their history and the preservation of our precious legacy. This leadership has been clearly and unequivocally recognized by the community of nations with only a few exceptions, who had chosen for so many years shadow over substance.   The governance of the nation and conditions of our oppression, whether the disposition and dispersion of exile or the brutality and repression of the occupation -- the Palestinian people cannot be torn asunder. They remain united, a nation, wherever they are or are forced to be. In Jerusalem, ladies and gentlemen, the city which is not only the soul of Palestine but the cradle of free-world religions is tangible, even in its claimed absence from our midst at this stage. Its apparent, though artificial, exclusion from this conference is a denial of its right to seek peace and redemption for it, too, has suffered through more an occupation.   Jerusalem, the city of peace, has been barred from the peace conference and deprived of its calling. Palestinian Jerusalem, the capital of our homeland and future state, defines Palestinian existence past, present and future, but itself has been denied a voice and an identity. Jerusalem defies exclusive possessiveness or bondage. Israel's annexation of Arab Jerusalem remains most clearly illegal in the eyes of the world community and an affront to the peace that this city deserves.   We come to you from a tortured land and a proud, though captive, people, having been asked to negotiate with our occupiers, but leaving behind the children of the intifada and the people under occupation and under curfew, who enjoyed us not to surrender or forget. As we speak, thousands of our brothers and sisters are languishing in Israeli prisons and detention camps, most detained without evidence, charge or trial, many cruelly mistreated and tortured in interrogation, guilty only of seeking freedom or daring to defy the occupation. We speak in their name, and we say, ""Set them free.""   . . . As we speak, the eyes of thousands of Palestinian refugees, deportees, and displaced persons since 1967 are haunting us for exile as a cruel fate. Bring them home. They have the right to return. As we speak, the silence of demolished homes echoes through the halls and in our minds.   We must rebuild our homes and our free state. And what do we tell the loved ones of those killed by army bullets? How do we answer the questions and the fear in our children's eyes for one out of three Palestinian children under occupation has been killed, injured or detained in the past four years?   How can we explain to our children that they are denied education or schools so often closed by the army . . . or why their life is in danger for raising a flag in the land where even children are killed or jailed? What requiem can be sung for trees uprooted by army bulldozers? And, most of all, who can explain to those whose lands are confiscated and free waters stolen?   . . . Remove the barbed wire, restore the land and its life-giving water. The settlements must stop now. Peace cannot be waged while Palestinian land is confiscated in myriad ways and the status of the occupied territories is being decided each day by Israeli bulldozers and barbed wire.   This is not simply a position. It is an irrefutable reality. Territory for peace is a travesty when territory for illegal settlement is official Israeli policy and practice. Settlements must stop now. Equal Partnership     In the name of the Palestinian people, we wish to directly address the Israeli people, with whom we have had a prolonged exchange of pain. Let us share hope, instead. We are willing to live side by side on the land and the promise of the future.   Sharing, however, requires two partners willing to share as equals. Mutuality and reciprocity requires -- must replace domination and hostility for genuine reconciliation and coexistence under international legality. Your security and ours are mutually dependent, as entwined as the fears and nightmares of our children.   We have seen some of you at your best and at your worst, for the occupier can hide no secrets from the occupied, and we are witness to the toll that occupation has exacted from you and yours. We have seen you anguish over the transformation of your sons and daughters into instruments of a blind and violent occupation, and we are sure that at no time did you envisage such a role for the children whom you thought would forge your future. We have seen you look back in deepest sorrow at the tragedy of your past and look on in horror at the disfigurement of the victim turned oppressor. Not for this have you nurtured your hopes, dreams and your offspring.                    . . .         To the co-sponsors and participants in this occasion of awe and challenge, we pledge our commitment to the principle of justice, peace, and reconciliation, based on international legitimacy and uniform standards. . . .  We shall pursue our people's right to self-determination, to the exhilaration of freedom and to the warmth of the sun as a nation among equals.   This is the moment of truth. You must have the courage to recognize it and the will to implement it, for our truth can no longer be hidden away in the dark recesses of inadvertency or neglect. People of Palestine look at you with straightforward, word-for-word, direct gaze, seeking to touch your heart, for you have dared to stir up hopes that cannot be abandoned.   You cannot afford to let us down, for we have lived up to the values you espoused and we have remained true to our cause. We, the Palestinian people, made the imaginative leap in the Palestine National Council of November 1988, during which the Palestine Liberation Organization launched its peace initiative based on Security Council Resolution 242 and 338 and declared Palestinian independence based on Resolution 181 of the United Nations, which gave birth to two states in 1948, Israel and Palestine. Mutual Recognition     In December 1988, a historic speech before the United Nations in Geneva led directly to the launching of the Palestinian-American dialogue. Ever since then, our people have responded positively to every serious peace initiative and has done its utmost to insure the success of this process.   Instead, on the other hand -- Israel, on the other hand, has placed many obstacles and barriers in the path of peace to negate the very -- the validity of the process. Its illegal and frenzied settlement activity is the most glaring evidence of its rejectionism, the latest settlement being erected just two days ago.   These historic decisions of the Palestine National Council wrenched the course of history from inevitable confrontation and conflict toward peace and mutual recognition. With our own hands and in an act of sheer will, we have molded the shape of the future of our people. Our parliament has articulated the message of the people, with the courage to say yes to the challenge of history, just as it provided a reference in its resolutions last month in Algiers and in the Central Council meeting this month in Tunis to go forward to this historic conference. We cannot be made to bear the brunt of other people's no. We must have reciprocity. We must have peace.                    . . .         Our homeland has never ceased to exist in our minds and hearts, but it has to exist as a state on all the territories occupied by Israel in the war of 1967, with Arab Jerusalem as its capital in the context of that city's special status and its nonexclusive character.   This state, in a conditional emergence, has already been a subject of anticipation for too long. It should take place today, rather than tomorrow. However, we are willing to accept the proposal for a transitional state, provided interim arrangements are not transformed into permanent status. The time frame must be condensed to respond to the dispossessed Palestinians' urgent need for sanctuary and to the occupied Palestinians' right to gain relief from oppression and to win recognition of their authentic will.   During this phase, international protection for our people is most urgently needed, and the -- the dual application of the Fourth Geneva Convention is a necessary condition. . . . Bilateral negotiations on the withdrawal of Israeli forces, the dissolution of Israeli administration, and the transfer of authority to the Palestinian people cannot proceed under coercion or threat in the current asymmetry of power. Israel must demonstrate its willingness to negotiate in good faith by immediately halting all settlement activity and land confiscation while implementing meaningful confidence-building measures.                    . . .         We are here today with the support of our people, who have given itself the right to hope and to make a stand for peace. We must recognize as well that some of our people harbor serious doubts and skepticism about this process.   Within our democratic social and political structures, we have evolved a respect for pluralism and diversity and we shall guard the opposition's right to differ within the parameters of mutual respect and national unity. . . . The process launched here must lead us to the light at the end of the tunnel. And this light is the promise of a new Palestine -- free, democratic, and respectful of human rights and the integrity of nature.   Self-determination, ladies and gentlemen, can neither be granted nor withheld at the will of the political self-interests of others. For it is enshrined in all international charters and humanitarian law. We claim this right. We firmly assert it here before you and in the eyes of the rest of the world.   For it is a sacred and inviolable right which we shall relentlessly pursue and exercise with dedication and self-confidence and pride. Let's end . . . this unnatural condition of occupation, which has already claimed too many lives.   No dream of expansion or glory can justify the taking of a single life. Set us free to re-engage as neighbors and as equals on our holy land. To our people in exile and under occupation who have sent us to this appointment, laden with their trust, love and aspirations, we say that the load is heavy and the task is great, but we shall be true.   In the words of our great national poet, Mahmoud Darwish, ""My homeland is not a suitcase and I am no traveler.""   To the exiled and the occupied, we say you shall return and you shall remain and we will prevail, for our cause is just. We will put on our embroidered robes and kaffiyehs and in the sight of the world and celebrate together on the day of liberation.   Refugee camps are not fit for people who had been reared on the land of Palestine in the warmth of the sun and freedom. The hail of Israeli bombs almost daily pouring down on our defenseless civilian population in the refugee camps of Lebanon is no substitute for the healing rain of the homeland. Yet the international will had insured their return in United Nations Resolution 194, a fact willfully ignored and unenacted.   Similarly, all other resolutions pertinent to the Palestinian question, beginning with Resolution 181 through Resolutions 242 and 338, and ending with Security Council Resolution 681, have until now been relegated to the domain of public debate rather than real implementation. They form the larger body of legality, including all relevant provisions of international law within which any peaceful settlement must proceed. FAROUK AL-SHARAA     The peoples of the entire world and not only the peoples of our region are buffeted by conflicting feelings toward this conference, feelings fluctuating between success and failure, between optimism in achieving peace and the pessimism of a regression to conflict and confrontation.   It is no exaggeration to state that the continuing intransigent Israeli position which is bereft of any justification is the one that places the world on the brink of incalculable dangers and prevents the region from enjoying peace.   The Arabs throughout their long history have always advocated peace, justice and tolerance. Their history, both ancient and modern, abounds with evidence to that effect. The Jews and oriental Jews in particular know better than anyone that they have lived among Muslim Arabs throughout history, wherever they happen to coexist, without ever suffering any form of persecution or discrimination, either racial or religious.   Rather, they have always lived in grace and dignity, participating in all walks of life. The Jews have never known a level of security, tolerance and equality approximating the security, tolerance and equality they have enjoyed in the lands of Arabs and Muslims.   Anyone perusing the pages of history today would realize the blatant contrast between this tolerance and full equality with which the Arabs treated the Jews for hundreds of years on the one hand, and the persecution, injustice and discrimination inflicted on the Arabs and particularly Palestinian Arabs languishing on the Israeli occupation on the other.   Suffice it to recall if only such a reminder were heeded, that had Israel's political orientation since 1948 been humane, millions of Arabs, Palestinians, Syrians and Lebanese would not have been uprooted from their homes nor -- nor would they have been denied, until today, their right to return. Had Israel's policies not been settler-colonialist, Palestinians languishing in the Israeli occupation since 1967 would not have been denied all their fundamental rights, foremost among which is their right to self-determination. . . .   The list of evidence of inhumane Israeli practices is long and well documented. These are practices which were condemned by dozens of resolutions adopted by the United Nations. These are practices of which the Israelis are tacitly cognizant themselves. They are known to many a fair-minded historian and journalist in the West. Although some do not dare address these practices frankly and unequivocally, for reasons which are, regrettably, not known to wide sections of European and U.S. public opinion. First, among these reasons is that Jewish extremists, both inside and outside Israel, harass those writers and journalists and jeopardize their livelihoods and future.   If they happen to be Christian, they're accused of being anti-Semitic, but if they are Arabs and Muslim, it is easiest to accuse them without any evidence whatsoever of terrorism and the intention of destroying Israel. Usurping Aggressors     Contrary to every law known, the burden of proof in the minds of these extremists is incumbent on the accused. Thus, the innocent becomes a suspect in the eyes of a large sector of Western public opinion. The aggressors who have usurped the land of others by force, thus, become the advocates of peace. Whereas, the victims of aggression, who demand the return of their occupied land and their usurped rights, become terrorists and destructive warmongers.   Distinguished co-chairmen, we have never carried the banner of war and destruction. Syria has consistently called for the achievement of comprehensive and just peace on the basis of United Nations resolutions. We have always emphasized our sincere intention and serious desire for peace.                    . . .         Peace and the usurpation of the land of others cannot coexist. For peace to be stable and durable, it must encompass all parties to the conflict on all fronts. Developments in our region have proved this fact. Israel exploited the signing of its peace with Egypt in 1979 to then proceed to annexing Jerusalem in 1980, the Golan in 1981 and invading Lebanon in 1982. It is clear that Israel perpetrated this series of aggressive acts at a pace that exceeds the pace of its withdrawal from the Egyptian Sinai.   In the aftermath of each act of aggression, the Security Council was called upon to convene and resolutions were unanimously adopted: Resolution 476, declaring the annexation of Jerusalem as null and void, Resolution 497, declaring the imposition of Israeli laws in the Golan as being null and void and with no international legal validity, and Resolution 425, calling for unconditional Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon.   However, as was the case with Resolutions 242 and 338, these resolutions were not implemented at the time, due to Israel rejection and intransigence and due to the atmosphere of the cold war between East and West. . . .   It is noteworthy to point out in this context the Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338, on the basis of which the peace conference is being convened, were adopted as a compromise between the permanent member states of the Security Council. As is well known, the majority of those states have been sympathetic to Israel since its creation.   Hence, the implementation of these two resolutions should not be the subject of new bargaining during bilateral negotiations. Rather, they should be implemented in all provisions and on all fronts. Resolution 242 emphasizes in its preamble the principle of the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war.   This means that every inch of Arab land occupied by the Israelis by war and force, the Golan, the West Bank, Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip, must be returned in their entirety to their legitimate owners.   International public opinion is aware more than ever before, and especially following the gulf crisis, that double standards are no longer acceptable in this age, that the principles of international law, not the law of the jungle, must be respected and that United Nations resolutions, not brute force, must be applied. Uprooting of Syrians     At last, the states of the world have also come to realize that Israel alone resists the efforts for peace with all the influence it can muster. It is Israel which perpetuates its occupation of the territories of others by force. All have come to realize that Israel follows a futile and obsolete ideology based on annexation, the building of settlements and the uprooting of Arabs from land in which they had lived for centuries in order to replace them with new immigrants who have never lived in this region.   In this regard, Syria would like to remind the co-sponsors of the conference and through them the international community that Israeli occupation of Syrian and Palestinian territories has resulted in uprooting approximately half a million Syrian citizens from the Golan who have to date not been able to return. The occupation has also resulted in the presence of over a quarter-million Palestinian refugees in Syria who are denied the right to return to the homeland of their fathers and forbears in Palestine.   The claims invoked by Israel for the migration of world Jewry to it at the expense of the native Arab population are not sanctioned by any legal or humanitarian principle. If the entire world were to adopt such claims, it would have to encourage all Christians to emigrate to the Vatican and all Muslims to emigrate to Holy Mecca.                    . . .         In order for a just peace to be established, no Arab land must remain under Israeli occupation, nor can the rights of the Palestinian people to self-determination remain denied. If the objective is truly for the peoples and the states of the region to co-exist, to enjoy security, peace and prosperity, to place their plentiful energies and resources at the service of their . . . development, how can such a desirable objective logically be realized without eliminating occupation and restoring legitimate rights?                    . . .         This firm Syrian position, whose every element is anchored in the principles of international legitimacy and the resolutions of the United Nations -- that position deems it imperative for Israel to withdraw from every inch of the occupied Syrian Golan, the West Bank, Jerusalem, the Gaza Strip and the south of Lebanon.   This position also deems it imperative to safeguard the legitimate, political and national rights of the Palestinian people, foremost among which is their right to self-determination. The building of settlements in the occupied Arab territories is an illegal action. It is considered null and void, and it stands as a major obstacle in the way of peace.   Thus, it is imperative that the settlements be removed. The continuation of settlement activity in the Arab-occupied territories, particularly since the peace process has commenced, is tangible evidence that Israel does not want to reach genuine peace.",https://www.nytimes.com/1991/11/01/world/middle-east-talks-3-speeches-area-dangerous-battleground-syrians-have-never.html,,"Following are excerpts from speeches delivered yesterday at the Middle East peace conference by the Israeli Prime Minister, Yitzhak Shamir; the leader of the Palestinian delegation, Haidar Abdel-Shafi, and the Syrian Foreign Minister, Farouk al-Sharaa.

Singing in a deep, quivering drone that occasionally recalls Leonard Cohen, Mr. Azrie performs his own musical settings of Arabic texts, both ancient and modern, to an exquisite accompaniment of flute, synthesizer, percussion and lute. The modern texts (for which translations are given both in English and French) are by poets who live in Syria, Lebanon, Iraq and Palestine.

OK,Copyright (c) 2022 The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved.,"  Following are excerpts from a televised speech by President Saddam Hussein today as translated by The Associated Press from a transcript distributed by the Iraqi News Agency:     Every year, on the 6th of January, we celebrate Army Day, the anniversary of the army of the nation in the great Iraq. We also reflect on the past, look at our present and project into the future . . . and the pride, sovereignty, liberation and victory that satisfies God that is awaiting us in a world whose lands are infested with scorpions, snakes, hypocrisy and oppression, and its oceans and seas filled with . . . sharks waiting for their prey. . . . This day has become a blessed occasion for Arabs in this phase as it has become a synonym of a glory illuminating the struggle of our kinfolk, the heroes of the stone in dear Palestine.    What a great pride it is, dear comrades in arms, that we belong to a march crowned with glory and satisfying God. . . . In this struggle that you are leading, you are fighting against social and economic oppression, against discrimination . . . , against the oppression pacticed by foreign powers . . . , against double standards, corruption and hegemony.    For these reasons, the battle in which you are locked today is the mother of all battles.   Let no one be deceived. The battle against the tyranny represented by the United States and the slogans of hegemony it is raising on the international and regional level and against the forces of infidelity so they be ousted from our holy lands is not expected to be a short one.   In one battle you had prepared a historical opportunity for which our forefathers had longed and died without witnessing it. That was the return of Kuwait to its Iraqi motherland -- a reality, not a wish or a claim, that made it the 19th province of the treasured political map of Iraq for the present and future times.    It is indeed a source of great pride to accomplish more than one goal in a single showdown. Together with the heroes of stones you have transformed the possibility of ousting the invaders into a tangible and visible reality. Our rendezvous with victory is very near, God willing.    Praise be to God, we are fortunate that this army has . . . grown to accomplish all its goals and take on the enemy within the borders of the homeland with all that has been placed at its disposal by the sons of this homeland. . . . A battle of such scope requires great sacrifices both in qualtity and quantity irrespective of the foreseen and unforeseen consequences, which will no doubt please the friend and anger the enemy.",https://www.nytimes.com/1991/01/07/world/confrontation-in-the-gulf-remarks-by-hussein-to-troops-on-kuwait.html,,Following are excerpts from a televised speech by President Saddam Hussein today as translated by The Associated Press from a transcript distributed by the Iraqi News Agency:,A,10,The New York Times,,,1991-01-07T05:00:00+0000,article,Foreign Desk,World,Text,nyt://article/58709a82-d991-54fc-9a1a-260aa3dec647,469,nyt://article/58709a82-d991-54fc-9a1a-260aa3dec647,Remarks by Hussein to Troops on Kuwait,CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF,NA,CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF; Remarks by Hussein to Troops on Kuwait,NA,NA,NA,AP,,AP,3371,1240,26,NA

OK,Copyright (c) 2022 The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved.,"  After years of dispute, the Israeli police have arrested an American-Israeli husband and wife in a West Bank Jewish settlement on a two-year-old extradition request from the United States. The couple are wanted for murder.   The Americans, Rachel and Robert Manning, are suspected of mailing letter bombs in California that killed a secretary in 1981 and a prominent Arab-American in 1985.   The Mannings, who are Jewish, came to Israel as immigrants several years ago, and their extradition has been a small but festering sore in Israeli-American relations for years.   The original extradition request by the United States, first made in 1989, was not enforced until now because of American diplomatic sensitivity over arresting the Mannings at their home in Kiryat Arba, a small settlement of right-wing Jews adjacent to the Palestinian city of Hebron.   The United States was reluctant to ask the Israeli police to arrest the Mannings there because the request might have implied American recognition of Israeli sovereignty over the West Bank.

OK,Copyright (c) 2022 The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved.,"  After years of dispute, the Israeli police have arrested an American-Israeli husband and wife in a West Bank Jewish settlement on a two-year-old extradition request from the United States. The couple are wanted for murder.   The Americans, Rachel and Robert Manning, are suspected of mailing letter bombs in California that killed a secretary in 1981 and a prominent Arab-American in 1985.   The Mannings, who are Jewish, came to Israel as immigrants several years ago, and their extradition has been a small but festering sore in Israeli-American relations for years.   The original extradition request by the United States, first made in 1989, was not enforced until now because of American diplomatic sensitivity over arresting the Mannings at their home in Kiryat Arba, a small settlement of right-wing Jews adjacent to the Palestinian city of Hebron.   The United States was reluctant to ask the Israeli police to arrest the Mannings there because the request might have implied American recognition of Israeli sovereignty over the West Bank.   The American Embassy in Tel Aviv said today that the problem of sovereignty was finally ""deemed not important"" by the Justice Department for the purpose of the extradition order.   Israel's Ministry of Justice, which ordered the arrest and will seek to put the extradition order into effect, said today that ""the Manning couple are suspected of mailing a package containing explosive material"" to a computer company in Manhattan Beach, Calif., in 1981.

By Amalia Barnea and Aharon Barnea. Translated by Chaya Amir. (Grove, $17.95.) At the end of ''Mine Enemy,'' Amalia and Aharon Barnea's account of how the Israeli couple come to respect and even love a Palestinian ''terrorist,'' the reader is left uncertain as to who the villains are in the Middle East. This is the measure of the success of the book, a best seller in Hebrew, now smoothly translated by Chaya Amir. ''Mine Enemy'' traces the Barneas' relationship with Lieut. Col. Salah Ta'mari, a commander of the Palestine Liberation Organization's forces who was captured during Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon. Mr. Barnea, the Arab affairs correspondent for Israel Radio, was offered the first interview; he arrived hot for the story but cold toward the colonel. He then had to reconcile his stereotype of a Palestinian with this student of T. S. Eliot who compares Zionists with Herod. If these are not complexities enough, Colonel Ta'mari is married to Dina Abd el-Hamid, the first wife of King Hussein of Jordan; some of the most disarming passages reflect the Barneas' gee-whiz attitude toward royalty. The journalists (she is a reporter for Yediot Aharonot, Israel's biggest newspaper) serve as go-betweens while Colonel Ta'mari is in jail, and win permission to take him on outings. Woven into the tale of unlikely friendship are biographies of the colonel and the queen, and eventually the Barneas' little girl is playing with Queen Dina's little grandson. This seems an obvious symbol for the brotherhood of man, but the Barneas serve it up without saccharine. Some of their analyses are simplistic: if the P.L.O. hides a military bunker under a hospital, can it protest the bombing of the hospital? But these do not detract from this readable description of the emotional morass of the Middle East.",7,17,The New York Times,,,1988-12-25T05:00:00+0000,article,Book Review Desk,Books,Review,nyt://article/39e7c0fa-7e66-5e4a-abd2-22882b41e50b,355,nyt://article/39e7c0fa-7e66-5e4a-abd2-22882b41e50b,IN SHORT: NONFICTION,NA,NA,IN SHORT: NONFICTION,NA,NA,NA,By Barth Healey,,NA,3371,1330,19,NA

He joined the Communist Party in 1925 and linked his ""advanced"" art to ""advanced"" politics. He left Germany in 1933 and studied with Webern in Vienna before making his way to Palestine, where he was influenced by his Jewish heritage. In 1938, he came to the United States where his music of opposition grew more refined until he succumbed to Parkinson's disease in 1972.

OK,Copyright (c) 2022 The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved.,"In what conceivable way can it be in the interest of Israel, America or the global coalition against Iraq for the Israeli Government to persist in its petulant bluster about the killings on the Temple Mount? Let us put the incident behind us, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir now tells President Bush. Yet it is his own Government that keeps attention fastened on the tragedy.   No one disputes that 21 Palestinians were killed and more than 100 wounded when Israeli police fired into a crowd. Mr. Shamir, however, continues to insist that the incident was a provocation planned by the Palestine Liberation Organization - as though that would justify shooting at unarmed civilians.   Worse, by refusing to cooperate with a United Nations inquiry, his Cabinet members act as though they were the victims. And still worse, Ariel Sharon, now the Housing Minister, is occupied with how to tell the United States where to get off. Israel has assured the U.S. that it would not settle Soviet emigres in East Jerusalem? Yes, but so what: he and a Cabinet committee now propose to install them there by the thousands.   These are peculiar ways to bring the tragedy to a reasonable resolution and to bring the world's attention back to Saddam Hussein's barbarities in Kuwait.   Americans can understand why Israel has little reason to think of the United Nations with warmth. Every year, for example, Arab countries use the General Assembly as a forum for hateful oratory and ritual votes to throw Israel out. Likewise, Americans alarmed by the possibility of poison gas attacks on U.S. troops may have a better appreciation of the sense of exposed loneliness that Israelis feel, especially when gas masks are being distributed to civilians.   The realities of Israeli politics may also intervene, as potential successors to the 75-year-old Mr. Shamir try to outdo each other in hawkish zeal. These realities might soon be further complicated: corruption indictments of minor party leaders could fracture the governing coalition and prompt a new Cabinet crisis.   All the more reason, therefore, for Israel not to estrange itself by flouting world concern about the Temple Mount tragedy. Mayor Teddy Kollek of Jerusalem sets an example of decency and good sense by offering to meet with and assist United Nations officials inquiring into the tragedy. If Mr. Shamir is serious about wanting a resolution, he could act in a similar spirit.   He need not embrace the U.N. inquiry in order, at least, to offer reasonable cooperation. More specifically, he can insist that the findings of the official investigation be promptly published - and shared with the U.N. And finally, he and his colleagues might wisely turn from berating their friends to defeating the common Iraqi enemy.",https://www.nytimes.com/1990/10/18/opinion/israel-s-friends-and-enemy.html,,"In what conceivable way can it be in the interest of Israel, America or the global coalition against Iraq for the Israeli Government to persist in its petulant bluster about the killings on the Temple Mount?

Habimah, the national theater company and the world's first Hebrew theater, was born in Moscow in 1917.

Both Israel and Jordan    did    sign and ratify the convention, Israel with a reservation.   The error does not affect my argument, however. Article 2 of the convention provides that the agreement applies ""to all cases of partial or total occupation of the territory of a high contracting party."" Thus the convention cannot apply because the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip have never been generally recognized as territories of Jordan. Jordan administered them as a belligerent occupant between 1948 and 1967, after a war of aggression against Israel in 1948. Jordan's attempt to annex these areas in 1950 was recognized only by Britain (except for Jerusalem) and perhaps by Pakistan.",https://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/01/opinion/israeli-settlement-and-the-geneva-convention.html,,To the Editor:,A,24,The New York Times,,,1992-04-01T05:00:00+0000,article,Editorial Desk,Opinion,News,nyt://article/25cf67b6-a6ec-5623-bf87-c5e5d49bd257,242,nyt://article/25cf67b6-a6ec-5623-bf87-c5e5d49bd257,Israeli Settlement and the Geneva Convention,NA,NA,Israeli Settlement and the Geneva Convention,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,3371,1410,48,NA

OK,Copyright (c) 2022 The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved.,"  There was great rejoicing in many academic circles last week over the release of sections of the Dead Sea Scrolls long held secret by a small band of scholars. But there was also a widespread sense that while new revelations might be in store, the best of what the scrolls have to offer is already known.   ""I think we pretty well know what is coming,"" said Dr. James C. VanderKam, professor of Hebrew Scriptures at the University of Notre Dame. ""More examples of what we already have."" And that means a more confident grasp of the origins of the Old Testament and the two great religions that sprung from it.   The new material is not expected to have near the seismic impact on scholarship made by the disclosures that followed the discovery in 1947 of the first scrolls in a cave on a cliff overlooking the Dead Sea, just south of Jericho. Over the next nine years, bedouins and archeologists unearthed 800 leather and papyrus manuscripts in the nearby caves and ruins.   From the beginning, the work of translating and publishing the manuscripts was entrusted to seven scholars; over the years they and their intellectual heirs have released what they say is 80 percent of the material. Last week, over the protests of the custodians, the Huntington Library in San Marino, Calif., where photographic copies of the scrolls are stored, began making the balance of the material available to the public.   The caution against high expectations expressed by Dr. VanderKam and seconded by many other scholars interviewed is twofold. For one thing the gist of much of the remaining material has already leaked out, through associates and students of the custodians.   Another reason for the caution is that scholars do not want to generate the high expectations that came with the initial finds three and four decades ago. Although startling to the academic world, the discovery never lived up to its billing. Early reports warned that the scrolls would undermine the authenticity of the Bible and rewrite the history of the early Christian church. In reality, the research has tended to confirm the integrity of the Hebrew Scripture and the accepted history of Christianity. Link With the Past    Still, the material already in the public domain continues to be regarded, in the words of scholar after scholar, as ""the greatest manuscript discovery of modern times,"" one that has confirmed and enriched contemporary knowledge of Judaism and Christianity. Scholars differ sharply on the details, but a few broad areas of consensus have emerged.   One of the most surprising discoveries was that, quite remarkably, the Scripture has not changed significantly in 2,000 years, although minor variations in words have been found and it has become clear that some sections were added later. Every book of the Old Testament, with the exception of the Book of Esther, was included in the find, either complete, as with Isaiah, or in fragments. Until the discovery, the earliest editions of these Hebrew Scriptures were from the Middle Ages.   From the point of view of the lay person sitting in church or synagogue, this meant that the Old Testament they were reading, whether in Hebrew or English translation, was true to the one in use in the first century.   For historians, many of the scrolls shed light on what religious life was like in early Palestine, around the time when the Second Temple of Jerusalem was destroyed, in 70 A.D., and numerous sects were vying for influence.   Most scholars believe that the majority of the Dead Sea Scrolls were written by one such sect, the Essenes, which flourished at Qumran for two centuries ending about 68 A.D. and held many of the beliefs later found in Christianity. The documents include descriptions of their religious practices and beliefs, including the conviction that the arrival of a messiah was imminent.    Of equal importance are polemics in which the elders of the Essene sect defended it against the Pharisees, the dominant strain of Judasim, and against other sects. Other documents tell of groups allied with the Essenes and their predecessors.   Since early Christianity shared with the Essenes an emphasis on messianism and other beliefs, and since the Pharisees, who moved many practices out of the temple and into the home and synagogue, were the precursors of rabbinic Judaism, the scrolls illuminate the connections and differences between the two faiths. While the Essenes died out and Christianity took on a life of its own, rabbinic Judaism survived to become what we know as Judaism today.    ""We used to think of Judaism as the mother and Christianity as the daughter religion,"" said Hershel Shanks, who as president of the Biblical Archeology Society waged a six-year battle to make the scrolls public. ""But now we see evidence that they are sibling religions. Both grew out of Second Temple Judaism, but emphasized different strands as if they were two children who had inherited different genetic material. Christianity emphasized the apocalyptic, the eschatological, the messianic. Judaism, on the other hand, emphasized the mitzvot -- the laws and the ethical commands of daily living.""   Several scholars said it was overstating the case to describe Judaism and Christianity as siblings -- they held fast to the mother-daughter analogy -- but they agreed that the scrolls have helped demonstrate the incredible diversity that Judaism enjoyed during and immediately after the Second Temple period.   From a theological point of view, many scholars said, the scrolls mean more to Christians than to Jews. Dr. Eileen Schuller, an associate professor of religious studies at McMaster University in Ontario, who has published widely on the scrolls, said that Christians have long acknowledged their debt to Judaism but that the scrolls helped forge stronger links. She cited, as an example, the Gospel of John, which had long been regarded by scholars as strongly influenced by Greek and Gnostic sources. Among the Dead Sea documents, however, are texts that used language and metaphor similar to those found in John.   ""It showed us the ties are ultimately to Judaism,"" she said.   Dr. Lawrence Schiffman, professor of Hebrew and Judaic Studies at New York University, said the scrolls are ""largely irrelevant"" from the point of view of modern Jewish movements since they descend from rabbinic Judaism.   ""Since the Qumran sect was opposed to the Pharisees, their writings aren't taken as authoritative for modern Jews,"" Dr. Schiffman said. But the scrolls are significant, he said, for ""the civil religion"" of Israel. By establishing the existence of Jews in Palestine, he said, the scrolls represent a historical claim of Jewish roots.   The Dead Sea Scrolls have fascinated scholars for half of the 20th century. As the veil of secrecy is lifted from the final portions, scholars are not expecting major revelations that will change their knowledge of two religions that have done so much to shape the world. But this has not dampened their enthusiasm as they marvel at how words left in caves 2,000 years ago continue to speak to the world today. The scholars who held back this legacy for so long have only served to heighten the drama.",https://www.nytimes.com/1991/09/29/weekinreview/ideas-trends-lessons-learned-from-unscrolling-two-religions-turbulent-pasts.html,,"There was great rejoicing in many academic circles last week over the release of sections of the Dead Sea Scrolls long held secret by a small band of scholars.

The judges said the emphasis on arrests and imprisonment, rather than prevention and treatment, failed to deal with the drug problem. Page 1.

Wolpe was born in 1902 into a comfortable Berlin Jewish business background, and grudgingly allowed to begin conventional musical training at the age of 14.  By the age of 17, however, he had joined the youthful rebellion that followed Germany's defeat at the end of World War I. Soon he found his way to Ferruccio Busoni, who counseled him on his early pieces, and to the Bauhaus, where Paul Klee was teaching. For the next decade, he participated in left-wing and avant-garde movements while partly supporting himself playing jazz piano in cabarets and movie theaters. By 1930, he was involved, like Kurt Weill and Hanns Eisler, in political theater and had joined the Communists.",https://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/05/archives/classical-music-from-obscurity-toward-light.html,"Stefan Wolpe wrote the monumental cantata ""Yigdal"" in 1945 for a Sabbath Eve service at the Park Avenue Synagogue in Manhattan.

Can you supply details? -- Angelo J. Brenna, New York N.Y.     A.  The Gypsy Pilgrimage takes place each May 24 and 25 at Stes.-Maries-de-la-Mer, about 14 miles south of Arles. Provencal legend says the place, in the marshlands of the Camargue, was where St. Marie Jacobe and St. Marie Salome and their servant, St. Sarah, among others, arrived safely on shore after being abandoned in a boat off Palestine. The three saints remained in the Camargue and were buried there. A church was built at their tomb in the ninth century, and the building was replaced in the 12th century. Gypsies (who call themselves Romany) consider Sarah their patron saint, and thousands of them, many of whom still live in caravans in their traditional nomadic life, arrive at the town each year. The pilgrimage events begin May 24 with a mass at 10 A.M. at the church. At 3 P.M. is the descente des chasses, in which the bones of the three saints are lowered by rope and pulley from an upper chapel to an altar in the chancel. At 4 P.M. there is the St. Sarah procession, in which a painted wood figure of the saint is taken to the sea for blessing. At 9:30 P.M. a mass is celebrated .",https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/14/travel/q-and-a-063293.html,,A Gypsy Pilgrimage,5,4,The New York Times,,,1993-03-14T05:00:00+0000,article,Travel Desk,Travel,Question,nyt://article/69ffbdbf-df4a-5f84-9c51-2024fac10dc6,1023,nyt://article/69ffbdbf-df4a-5f84-9c51-2024fac10dc6,Q AND A,NA,NA,Q AND A,NA,NA,NA,By Carl Sommers,,NA,3371,1720,32,NA

OK,Copyright (c) 2022 The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved.,"  Arab members of the coalition at war with Iraq reaffirmed their united stand today and called on Baghdad to withdraw from ""all Kuwaiti territories without conditions or strings.""    At the end of a two-day meeting here, the countries also underlined their intention to play a major role in charting the future of the Middle East.   The countries represented here betrayed not the slightest intention of giving any ground to Iraq and its conditional offer to withdraw from Kuwait. They reaffirmed indirectly, but forcefully, that those countries who stood with Iraq in the Arab world, as well as the Palestine Liberation Organization, would be punished by being deprived of financial aid.   In a communique, the eight countries -- Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Syria, Bahrain, Oman, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and the exiled Kuwaiti Government -- expressed their ""extreme sadness for what is happening to the two innocent peoples of Kuwait and Iraq because of the continuing occupation of Kuwait by Iraq."" But they left little doubt they favor a continuation of the Persian Gulf war until the total defeat of President Saddam Hussein. 'No Comfort' for Hussein     ""Saddam Hussein can take absolutely no comfort from what transpired here,"" said Abdallah Yaacoub Bishara, the secretary general of the Gulf Cooperation Council, which groups all the Arab oil producers at war with Iraq.   Several ministers and other senior officials also showed a deliberately cold attitude towards the P.L.O. and its leader, Yasir Arafat, when they underlined that their commitment to the Palestinians is limited to their cause, not the organization's leadership.    ""There is no change in regards to safeguarding the rights of the Palestinian people but that cannot be attached to this Palestinian leader or that Palestinian leader,"" said Syria's Foreign Minister. Farouk Al Shara.   Mr. Shara, speaking at a news conference after the meeting, said that the United States and the European Community had given ""repeated assurances"" to Syria that they will turn their attention after the gulf war toward resolving the 40-year-long Arab-Israeli conflict. Arab Peacekeepers Not Discussed     The Arab ministers, however, said little about future mutual security plans to insure the region against further upheavals. They declined to discuss whether an Arab peacekeeping force would be stationed permanently in the gulf or what amounts of money would be set aside to further the economic development of the poorer Arab countries, like Egypt and Syria, who are members of the anti-Iraqi coaltion.   Arab Gulf officials indicated they resisted ""being pinned down on a number"" on financial aid, said one such official who asked not to be identified. ""We wanted to preserve the flexibility of tying our aid directly to our national interest,"" the official added.    Instead, the coalition said that ""cooperation and coordination"" will be open to ""all Arab countries"" provided they choose to ""adhere with the principles and goals"" that prevail among the coalition members.   In other words, senior officials from the Arab coaliltion explained, countries like Jordan, Algeria, Tunisia, and Yemen, as well as the P.L.O., which are aligned with Iraq and hostile to the coalition, stand little chance of benefitting from Arab generosity once the gulf war is over. Goals and Principles Outlined     The rough outlines of the principles and goals of the coalition in the future were described in the final statement of the meeting.   The countries said they would like a new Arab order to be based on principles that include the Arab League's ""mutual defense treaty,"" which prevents the use of force by any member against the other and the resolution of disputes by ""peaceful negotiations.""   It also said the ""concept of collective Arab security will be part and parcel of international security and peace,"" suggesting that the United Nations will remain the final arbitrer of disputes.    The communique asserted the necessity of ""respecting the sovereignty of each Arab country over its own natural resources,"" thus dismissing any notion that Arab oil wealth must be shared by all Arabs.    The eight countries said they will meet again in Damascus on March 5.",https://www.nytimes.com/1991/02/17/world/war-in-the-gulf-arabs-arab-allies-reaffirm-unity-despite-iraqi-proposal.html,,"Arab members of the coalition at war with Iraq reaffirmed their united stand today and called on Baghdad to withdraw from ""all Kuwaiti territories without conditions or strings.""",1,21,The New York Times,,,1991-02-17T05:00:00+0000,article,Foreign Desk,World,News,nyt://article/c3fae2cc-af04-5369-9540-71a677c93512,679,nyt://article/c3fae2cc-af04-5369-9540-71a677c93512,WAR IN THE GULF: Arabs; Arab Allies Reaffirm Unity Despite Iraqi Proposal,NA,NA,WAR IN THE GULF: Arabs; Arab Allies Reaffirm Unity Despite Iraqi Proposal,NA,NA,NA,"By Youssef M.

But if that is true, it is only the latest in a succession of ''worst yet'' moments since 1975, when the war began. Here is a look at several of those periods: Autumn 1975: Five months after the war begins, Lebanon is shocked when 50 people are killed in the collapse of an old hotel in downtown Beirut after artillery duels between Muslims and Christians. Daily exchanges destroy the city's commercial center and the first-class seaside hotels. Business shifts away from the Green Line to shops deep within the Muslim and Christian halves of Beirut. Militiamen on each side of the line come to control the streets, and an exodus of civilians begins. But the airport remains open, and schools open and close depending on the fighting. Autumn 1978: Muslim militiamen, who had returned to hideouts when Syrian troops arrived in 1976, take to the streets again as Christians come under Syrian bombardment. As Christians in East Beirut huddle in building basements and stairwells, life is relatively normal in the Muslim sector. Christian gunmen in speeding cars attack Syrian checkpoints. Christian newspapers say 300 people are killed in one day. Summer 1982: After 80,000 Israeli soldiers invade Lebanon to evict Palestine Liberation Organization forces, a daily bombardment by Israelis of Muslim areas from air and sea causes havoc. The Israelis, now in East Beirut, cut off power and water to the Muslim sector to force the P.L.O. to evacuate West Beirut. Eventually, P.L.O. and Syrian forces leave. But in September, hundreds of people are massacred at Sabra and Shatila, Palestinian camps in southern Beirut, by Lebanese Christian militiamen allowed into the camps by Israeli troops. A multinational peacekeeping force of American, Italian and French troops arrives in West Beirut, where Christian units of the Lebanese Army are in charge. The Green Line comes down. Winter 1984: Four months after 241 United States servicemen and 58 French troops are killed in bombing attacks, West Beirut falls to Muslim forces and the multinational contingents leave. The Green Line is re-established, and militias again rule the streets of West Beirut and the southern suburbs. A wave of terror and hostage-taking against Westerners by Shiite fundamentalists follows. Amal, the main Shiite militia, seeks to head off the return of Palestinian guerrillas by attacking Palestinians entrenched in the outskirts of Beirut. But in much of the rest of the city, life goes on uninterrupted. The airport, which is near the worst Palestinian-Shiite fighting, closes for a few days but soon reopens. Winter 1987: After a week of savage street battles between rival Shiite and Druse gunmen leaves 250 people dead, Syrian troops return to West Beirut at the request of local Muslim leaders. The Syrians end the reign of militias on the streets. Life not only returns to normal, but business resumes and a boom unseen in 10 years begins. But the Syrians stay out of the southern suburbs, which by now have become the base for Shiite fundamentalists backed by Iran.",4,4,The New York Times,,,1989-04-23T05:00:00+0000,article,Week in Review Desk,Week in Review,Chronology,nyt://article/853ae831-1b3e-533d-9f22-ee2b31526b28,602,nyt://article/853ae831-1b3e-533d-9f22-ee2b31526b28,THE WORLD: Approaching the Limits of Lebanon's Endurance; The Ebb and Flow of Beirut's Agony,NA,NA,THE WORLD: Approaching the Limits of Lebanon's Endurance; The Ebb and Flow of Beirut's Agony,NA,NA,NA,By Ihsan A.

OK,Copyright (c) 2022 The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved.,"  If there's a living soul who embodies the city of Jerusalem, it's Teddy Kollek. This is a lament for the city, and for him, because he has made his life's work trying to revive it, beautify it and bring it harmony.   But it has wrenched itself apart in fear, hatred and violence. Not that Teddy weeps; it isn't his way. He still storms around, tongue-lashing the arrogant and the fanatic, crowing delight at the greenery, the great art and music brought to give warmth to the old stones and the hopes they symbolize.   Teddy -- everyone calls him that -- has been Mayor since 1965. When he was first elected, there was a high tin wall next to his office in the Municipal Building, a shield to protect people in the streets from snipers on the Old City walls nearby.   After the 1967 war, all the physical barriers were torn down. Teddy plunged into ceaseless activity to unite the city, if not in friendship -- that was too much to ask -- at least in mutual acceptance and neighborliness.   For a long time, Jerusalem was a virtual island of calm as waves of bloody anger rose around it. That was not by happenstance. Teddy, who is known for falling asleep on public occasions, habitually spent only three or four hours a night in bed so he could look after the hospitals and schools and parks he was building, visit all kinds of people, deliver his message of good will and try to make amends for provocation.   It wasn't surprising that when the Government of Israel refused to receive a United Nations delegation after the recent killings on the Temple Mount, Teddy's was the one voice saying he would be glad to see anyone who wanted to talk to him. His is a voice of reason. ""The world is a better place when moderates run it,"" he has said.   He was born in Vienna in 1911 and joined a Zionist youth group as a teen-ager. He undertook clandestine missions around Europe to help save Jews from Hitler, settling in Palestine in 1935 as a pioneer. As an aide to David Ben-Gurion, who became Israel's first Prime Minister when the state was founded in 1948, he was closely involved in the dreams and pains of its creation.   He never did well in national politics. He is too blunt, too demanding and straightforward, too attentive to the details of everyday human troubles to get on with the party apparatus, as Israel's unwieldy system requires for advancement. But the same qualities brought him such personal admiration and affection that he has always been re-elected Mayor.   It was not without constant quarrels. Nationalists say he does too much for Arabs. He bemoans constraints on attending to their needs as fellow citizens. Worried about youth gangs, he multiplied diversions -- festivals, sports to keep young people busy. But when he wanted to build a municipal swimming pool, he was called ""too Hellenistic.""   Still, it worked for a time. As late as last year, only one Palestinian had been killed in Jerusalem while hundreds died in the occupied territories, and the police had never fired live ammunition at rioters. Now the toll is mounting.   The ranks of die-hard fundamentalists are growing on both sides. Meron Benvenisti, his former Deputy Mayor who parted ways with his boss years ago over Teddy's insistence on looking at the bright side, has called him ""a hero in a tragedy.""   But he also pointed out, ""Jerusalem isn't a piece of real estate, it's a symbol for both sides, and symbols are indivisible and exclusive. The Palestinians aren't looking for good government, they're after a political identity, self-esteem, their own flag. If you think they'll settle for better sewers and roads, you're mad.""   Teddy refuses to despair. Undermined, saddened, he seeks reason for consolation. From the telephone in his car as he raced about, he told me: ""It's been a bad few weeks. But fewer people have been killed in Jerusalem than in other cities this size. I hear  [ New York's ]  Mayor Dinkins is talking about a curfew to control crime. Of course it's different; here it's nationalism and there it's crime.""   He's still finding practical ways to improve the city's life on both sides of the emotional divide. There's no question, he said, of a big new settlement for Soviet immigrants in East Jerusalem, as the Israeli Government suggested. He's planning 7,000 new apartments for Arab housing.   ""We're all in a bad mood now. But we all know there's no choice, we'll be together forever. Wait a few weeks until it simmers down, before we can talk and make sense.""   But it isn't going that way. Teddy will be 80 in May. ""It's a different generation, they aren't heard,"" another Israeli commented. Not only the story of Teddy's life will seem vain if another generation fails to join his endless work for a Jerusalem at peace.",https://www.nytimes.com/1990/10/24/opinion/foreign-affairs-lament-for-jerusalem.html,,"If there's a living soul who embodies the city of Jerusalem, it's Teddy Kollek.

He never did well in national politics. He is too blunt, too demanding and straightforward, too attentive to the details of everyday human troubles to get on with the party apparatus, as Israel's unwieldy system requires for advancement. But the same qualities brought him such personal admiration and affection that he has always been re-elected Mayor.   It was not without constant quarrels. Nationalists say he does too much for Arabs. He bemoans constraints on attending to their needs as fellow citizens. Worried about youth gangs, he multiplied diversions -- festivals, sports to keep young people busy. But when he wanted to build a municipal swimming pool, he was called ""too Hellenistic.""   Still, it worked for a time. As late as last year, only one Palestinian had been killed in Jerusalem while hundreds died in the occupied territories, and the police had never fired live ammunition at rioters. Now the toll is mounting.   The ranks of die-hard fundamentalists are growing on both sides. Meron Benvenisti, his former Deputy Mayor who parted ways with his boss years ago over Teddy's insistence on looking at the bright side, has called him ""a hero in a tragedy.""   But he also pointed out, ""Jerusalem isn't a piece of real estate, it's a symbol for both sides, and symbols are indivisible and exclusive. The Palestinians aren't looking for good government, they're after a political identity, self-esteem, their own flag. If you think they'll settle for better sewers and roads, you're mad.""   Teddy refuses to despair. Undermined, saddened, he seeks reason for consolation. From the telephone in his car as he raced about, he told me: ""It's been a bad few weeks. But fewer people have been killed in Jerusalem than in other cities this size. I hear  [ New York's ]  Mayor Dinkins is talking about a curfew to control crime. Of course it's different; here it's nationalism and there it's crime.""   He's still finding practical ways to improve the city's life on both sides of the emotional divide. There's no question, he said, of a big new settlement for Soviet immigrants in East Jerusalem, as the Israeli Government suggested. He's planning 7,000 new apartments for Arab housing.   ""We're all in a bad mood now. But we all know there's no choice, we'll be together forever. Wait a few weeks until it simmers down, before we can talk and make sense.""   But it isn't going that way. Teddy will be 80 in May. ""It's a different generation, they aren't heard,"" another Israeli commented. Not only the story of Teddy's life will seem vain if another generation fails to join his endless work for a Jerusalem at peace.",https://www.nytimes.com/1990/10/24/opinion/foreign-affairs-lament-for-jerusalem.html,,"If there's a living soul who embodies the city of Jerusalem, it's Teddy Kollek.

OK,Copyright (c) 2022 The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved.,"  As the Persian Gulf war grew more complex, one of the most hectic weeks in Wall Street history ended yesterday with a last-minute flurry that carried the Dow Jones industrial average ahead 23.27 points.   The gain, the fourth in a row and in spite of an Iraqi missile attack on Israel early yesterday morning, brought the Dow to 2,646.78. For the week, the bellwether index added 145.29 points, or 5.8 percent, the biggest weekly point gain in history. The previous biggest point gain came in the week ended Oct. 19, 1990, when the Dow jumped 122.77 points, partly on signs that Iraq was seeking a peaceful settlement to the gulf crisis.   This week's gain in percentage terms was just short of a 5.9 percent rise in June 1988, when interest rates appeared to be declining.  Late Burst of Trading     Volume was strong yesterday, with 226.8 million shares traded, a third in the final hour. Traders attributed the late activity to a call by an Iraqi official for ""genuine negotiation.""   The day before, amid euphoria that allied military forces seemed headed for a quick victory over Iraq, harried traders strained under a flood of buy orders that lifted trading to 318.9 million shares.    It was the heaviest trading flow since the Monday after the October plunge of 1989.    Yesterday's increase went far beyond the Dow blue chips. The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks climbed 1.3 percent. On the Big Board, 21 stocks rose to new highs, 836 advanced and 678 declined. Still, 32 stocks dropped to new lows.    ""Everybody thought the market would drop after Iraq attacked Israel,"" said William M. LeFevre, market strategist for Advest Inc. ""But when it didn't drop very much at the opening and crude oil kept going down, up went stocks to the highest level since mid-August."" Crude oil fell $2.19, to $19.25 a barrel.    In a more candid assessment, Donald Tierney, metals analyst for Fortune Commodities, told the Dow Jones news service that ""headline trading"" drove the market.    Minute after minute, news tickers reported every scrap of information and rumor from the war. Much of it dealt with Israel: whether it would retaliate against Iraq, that sirens were going off in Israel and Saudi Arabia, that the Pentagon doubted that Iraq had fired more missiles, that President Saddam Hussein had sent his family out of the country.    At 2 P.M., two hours before the close, the Dow stood at roughly 2,620 -- about where it ended the day before.    But at 3:17, the ticker carried a Cable News Network interview with Iraq's Ambassador to the United Nations, Abdul Amir al-Anbari, in which he called on President Bush to try ""genuine negotiation"" to end the war.    ""There's no problem that cannot be solved peacefully,"" he said.    Within minutes, the Dow was ahead nearly 30 points, fell back a little, rose slightly again, and again fell back.    The Ambassador linked the negotiations to the Palestine question, a position the Administration has rejected. The Dow, however, held most of its gain.  Move by Program Traders    The news came a few minutes after program traders moved heavily into the market, driving the Dow 15 points higher. Further waves of program buying raised the Dow 38 points, Birinyi Associates said.    While the Dow was up 20 points earlier in the day, one trader said, tickers reported that a new volley of missiles had been fired at Israel, immediately bringing the index down sharply. The report was later discredited.    Still earlier rumors circulated that President Hussein had been shot by one of his generals. That was also denied, but the rumor, coming at a time the Dow was down a few points, pushed the Dow up 15.  Up and Down Swings    Every turn in the market brought much the same. Good news prompted traders to buy technology stocks, motor stocks and drug, food, beverage and tobacco issues. Bad news reversed the process and investors, speculators and traders unloaded what they had just bought.    In one of the clearest signs that Wall Street fears seemed to have lightened, people told jokes again.    ""All through this week,"" a trader remarked, ""nobody's been telling jokes because things are too serious. But because the war seems to be going our way, people are trying to lighten up the situation.""    CNA Financial, controlled by the Tisch family, soared 8 3/4, to 78 1/2, in a strong insurance group after rising 5 3/4 Thursday. A short war would be favorable to insurers in that it would lessen deterioration of real estate assets. AIG, an insurance industry leader, jumped 3, to 80.
